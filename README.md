Data Science / Analytics is all about finding valuable insights from the given dataset. 
In short, Finding answers that could help business. 
In this tutorial, We will see how to get started with Data Analysis in Python. 
The Python packages that we use in this notebook are:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Since usually such tutorials are based on in-built datasets like iris, It becomes harder for the learner to connect with the analysis and hence learning becomes difficult. 
To overcome this, The dataset that we use in this notebook is IPL (Indian Premier League) 2008-2020 Dataset posted on Kaggle Datasets. 
IPL is one of the most popular cricket tournaments in the world, 
thus the problems we try to solve and the questions that we try to answer should be familiar to anyone who knows Cricket.
